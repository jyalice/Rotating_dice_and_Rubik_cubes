# Rotating dice & Rubik's cubes

## "For the road was so far and so distant was my journey, and I wanted to go up and down, seeking my heart's desire.""Oh, rarely, rarely the time is given! I wish I could play here a little longer." 

## Above are a few poems by Qu Yuan. To commemorate this great poet and politician, people eat traditional food Zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival. This time we use pictures of Zongzi to make a rotating dice as well as two Rubik's cubes. Many thanks to Pujipujiji and SATPEDIA.

## In the upper right corner, there are three small rotating dices. Click the white one (or click the dice button), the big rotating dice will be shown on the webpage; click the red one (or click the cube1 button), the webpage will be scrolled to the first rotating Rubik's cube; click the blue one (or click the cube2 button), the webpage will be scrolled to the second rotating Rubik's cube.

## Animation effects besides rotation: squares of the first Rubik's cube will fly up and then back, and the images on the squares will change; squares of the second Rubik's cube will turn over and then back, and their images will also change.
